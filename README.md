This is the code for the basic Linear Regression using Gradient Descent Algorithm

# Overview
I'm using a small dataset of student test scores and the amount of hours they studied. I've used linear regression to get the relationship.

# Dependencies
numpy
Python 2 and 3.

# Usage
Just run python3 test.py to see the results:

Starting gradient descent at b = 0, m = 0, error = 5565.107834483211
Running...
After 1000 iterations b = 0.08893651993741346, m = 1.4777440851894448, error = 112.61481011613473
